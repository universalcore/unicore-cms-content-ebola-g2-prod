The illness affects humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees).\r\n\r\nEbola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in a village near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the other in a remote area of Sudan.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the virus is unknown but fruit bats (Pteropodidae) are considered the likely host of the Ebola virus, based on available evidence.\r\n",
